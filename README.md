## What is this?

I built this project in the summer of 2020 as part of the Thinkful fullstack bootcamp. 

I built the React client when learning frontend and built the Express server and PostgreSQL database while learning the backend. Immediately after finishing the client, I got a contract position doing React development, so I came back later to finish the backend, and deployed it in December 2020. The backend may be found in a pinned repo called noteful-server.

-and added a few emojis since there are no colors.
